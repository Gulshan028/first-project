My name is Gulshan.
I live in Nagpur.
I am applying for the pWc company as it has recently opened the office here in Nagpur.
Also, there are several other companies which are MNC's and I will surely apply there alongside my preparation for Microsoft.
I am planning to take a course reset asap after getting the job. But I won't join the MS from Woolf university readily.
